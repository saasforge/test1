### Note
1. I used the assumption that the start direction is directed down, to the south.
2. I think you probably confused L and R, or maybe they look opposite from the turtle point of view. Because only when I shifted L and R, I was able to obtain the result (-1, 3) from your assignment.

### Running app
1. Create a virtual environment with *python -m venv venv* (or python3 on Mac)
2. Install all packages with *pip install -r requirements.txt*
3. Run the application and enjoy!
4. You can choose a file from your computer and change the step size.
5. The points where the turtled visited more than once are highlighted with red.
